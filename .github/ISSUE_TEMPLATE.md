Here you can report bugs or ask for new features. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a better place for "how-to" questions. 

When reporting a bug, please include a minimal, self-contained example that reproduces the problem and test it with the development version of "terra", or at least with the current version on CRAN. Always report the output of `packageVersion("terra")` and your operating system.
